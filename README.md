# Introduction
A final project authored by Cory Suzuki, Nathaniel Talampas, and Richard Diaz DeLeon for Dr. Seungjoon Lee's Unsupervised Learning class. Here we perform dimensionality reduction techniques for feature extraction and utilize clustering methods to analyze insightful trends on the classification of phishing and scam emails.

# Motivation
In today's digital age, phishing attacks have become a major threat to individuals and organizations alike. These attacks exploit users' trust, resulting in significant financial losses and breaches of sensitive information. To address this widespread issue, it is crucial to develop effective methods for identifying and mitigating phishing attempts.

Clustering, which is an unsupervised machine learning technique, offers a valuable way to analyze and group URLs based on their unique characteristics without requiring pre-labeled data. By applying X method...


# About-The-Data
The Phishing URL Dataset consists of URLs labeled as either phishing or legitimate. Phishing URLs are designed to deceive users into providing sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, often mimicking legitimate sites.
